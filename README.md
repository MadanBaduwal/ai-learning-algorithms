# learning-paradigms / type of learning in machine learning / machine learning modalities

## Supervise Learning

Label Datasets


## Unsupervise Learning

Unlabel Datasets

## Reinforcement Learning

reinforcement learning: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning

## Semi-Supervise Learning

(hybrid)(half label data + half unlabel data)


## Transfer Learning

(statistical inference)

n transfer learning, we first train a base network on a base dataset and task, and then we repurpose the learned features, or transfer them, to a second target network to be trained on a target dataset and task. This process will tend to work if the features are general, meaning suitable to both base and target tasks, instead of specific to the base task.


## Self-supervise learning

(Hybrid learning)(supervise+ unsupervise + reinforcement)(pretext task)

- Example: a model can be trained to predict the missing word in a sentence, to predict the next word given the previous ones, or to classify the rotation angle of an image. 

## Fine tunning learning

In deep learning, fine-tuning is an approach to transfer learning in which the weights of a pre-trained model are trained on new data.[1] Fine-tuning can be done on the entire neural network, or on only a subset of its layers, in which case the layers that are not being fine-tuned are "frozen" (not updated during the backpropagation step).[2] A model may also be augmented with "adapters" that consist of far fewer parameters than the original model, and fine-tuned in a parameter-efficient way by tuning the weights of the adapters and leaving the rest of the model's weights frozen.
